### Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used for any election by making some modifications to the script. One way this can be used in other elections is to collect election data in a similar format containing 'Ballot ID', 'County', and 'Candidate', download and import election data, and change the path and file to load and run the script. Another way to continue and modify this script for future use is to update the .csv file and incorporate demorgraphic information to make deeper analyses.
